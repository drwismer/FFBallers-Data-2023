"Patrick Mahomes","KC","10","1","453.4","1.0","9.3","2.03","1","It doesn’t get much better than MVP, Super Bowl MVP, and arguably one of the most consistent fantasy seasons for a pocket passer ever. He broke his own record for most top-12 performances in a season with 15. Despite losing Tyreek Hill, Mahomes improvised on the fly, and 34 of 41 of his passing TDs (83 %) came inside the red zone. He said before the season “I’ll be able to spread the ball around more this year” and he delivered with 11 different pass-catchers hauling in a TD. Apart from Travis Kelce, it’s hard betting on anyone else but when it comes to Mahomes, we’re not betting against him repeating his magic. Paying up for an elite QB like him in the 3rd round is viable.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

His career-high 20 turnovers almost didn’t even matter as he actually averaged more fantasy points per game and rushing yards when he threw an INT. He’s everything you could want from a fantasy QB and should be the QB1 in redraft yet again. The fantasy landscape is changing so paying up for him in the second round can work with the proper roster construction.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+.

He was #1 in expected fantasy points, #1 in road fantasy points per game (27), and #1 in passer rating versus zone coverage. He improved massively as a passer but what made his fantasy season was his work on the ground. He averaged 11 rush attempts per game, finished with 13 rushing TDs, and the most red zone rush attempts of all-time for a QB. He’s firmly established himself in the elite tier for fantasy and deserves to be in the conversation as a top-3 round pick in 2023.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+.

From Week 3 on, the Bengals ranked 2nd in pass rate over expectation, 2nd in expected points per play, and he threw the ball on 1st down at a higher rate than anyone else in the league. Burrow ended up 2nd in passing TDs, 4th in fantasy points per game, and 5th in passing yards. He did all this without Ja’Marr Chase for over a month and a banged-up offensive line. It’s hard for him to match the truly elite tier without the added rushing upside that other QBs possess but Burrow’s boom games are always just around the corner.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+.

Lamar had us guessing and reinterpreting and confused every week until we finally got clarity right before the NFL Draft. He’s a Raven! The former league MVP has quietly become more boom-bust than you might realize. After the lowest yards per attempt (6.9) of his career, it might be easy to be out on Lamar. But running QBs are the great equalizer in fantasy. Keep in mind that 60+ rushing yards and a score is the same as 300 passing yards in most leagues. The combination of Mark Andrews, Odell Beckham Jr., Rashod Bateman, and new rookie Zay Flowers is more than serviceable to keep opposing defenses honest. Lamar has gone from late round QB darling to league MVP to fantasy disappointment and perhaps a value in 2023.

Despite totaling the 3rd most completions in NFL history, it was all short, short, short, and short again. He ranked 31st in aDOT and finished with only two top-5 QB finishes on the year. The Chargers switched up their offensive coordinator and Kellen Moore’s arrival should open up the offense and capitalize on Herbert’s strength throwing the football down the field. He can return to 35+ passing TDs but without a flood of rushing TDs, it will be tough for him to return to the QB2 season he had in 2021.

The Bears came out sluggish and utterly embarrassing for fantasy and then the team had a drastic switch in approach in Week 6. From that moment on, he averaged 24.8 fantasy points per game and OC Luke Getsy decided to utilize more and more designed run calls. His rushing numbers were historic, averaging 7.1 yards per carry (highest in the NFL) and the most QB scrambles of all time. He tied Lamar Jackson for the most games (7) of 80+ rushing yards in a season. The upside is immense and after adding WR DJ Moore to the mix, Fields can be a top-5 QB in our book.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

He was solid in the 2nd half of the year with six top-12 performances. He’s in the conversation as a top-8 fantasy QB again this next year with upside to finish in the top-5 if things break right. His receiving options are solid and adding Calvin Ridley to the mix only helps him.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Geno Smith","SEA","5","9","344.5","3.0","6.7","10.10","3","Smith surpassed anyone’s expectations last year but for fantasy, his season needs some context. From Week 3 on, he had ten top-12 finishes (as many as Joe Burrow in that span), but he was more steady than putting up elite performances. He led all QBs in completion rate (69.8%) and TDs (14) of 20+ yards downfield. In fact, almost 50 percent of his passing TDs were of the deep variety. We shouldn’t take anything away from the Comeback Player of the Year but it’s hard seeing him repeat a top-5 year yet again. Luckily, you don’t have to pay that draft cost in 2023 and the team clearly wanted to outfit him with more weapons from the NFL Draft. He’s one of the few late round QBs we are collectively all about.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

The Browns offense was noticeably worse in almost every major offensive category compared to Jacoby Brissett. For 2023, he certainly possesses some of the upside you might be looking for in a later round QB. Legal and moral issues aside, Watson is a former top-5 finisher at the position stuck in an offense that prefers to control the clock on the ground.

The major red flag was a career-high 15 INTs and now head coach Mike McCarthy says he wants to run the ball more bringing in new offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer. Maybe the presence of Brandin Cooks evens things out because the Cowboys lacked any semblance of a threat behind Ceedee Lamb last year in the passing game. We like Dak as a back-end QB1 but his days of top-5 upside are likely out the window.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Daniel Jones","NYG","13","12","339.0","3.7","5.8","10.11","4","If you are Daniel Jones, you need to be getting a full back tattoo of HC Brian Daboll. From failed franchise QB to franchise cornerstone, Jones led the league with a 1.1% INT rate and he also led in adjusted completion rate (81.1%), but it was his work on the ground that led to some big games averaging 44 rushing yards per contest. His Week 17 performance (36.2 fantasy points) won people fantasy championships and the lack of turnovers was a complete 180 from years past. But keep in mind that Jones was a top-10 QB only five times so it was hard for managers to fully trust rolling him out there until the end of the season. The Giants gave him a long-term extension so Danny Dimes is officially Danny Big Bills these days. Despite adding Darren Waller to the mix, he’s still a middling QB2 when you stat out the passing volume for this offense.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+.

He broke out with new head coach Mike McDaniel leading the league in yards per attempt (8.9) and tying Patrick Mahomes for the highest TD rate (6.3%) in the NFL. Roll the dice again in the later rounds but keep in mind the Dolphins early season schedule (@LAC, @NE, DEN) and recognize that big plays will continue to happen with Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle in town.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+.

Head coach Kevin O’Connell‘s pass-happy approach definitely was a breath of fresh air after living under the disgruntled Mike Zimmer for years. The Vikings were a weekly roller coaster going 11-0 in one-score games but Kirk averaged 280 yards and two passing TDs in those contests.

Lions home games averaged 58.4 points per game (#1 in the NFL) and Goff smashed all year long there averaging 21.3 fantasy points, 274 passing yards, & 2.6 passing TDs per game. Goff’s 16 passing TDs inside the 5-yard line were 2nd in the NFL behind Mahomes and the 4th most over the last five years. This offense should continue to ascend with Jameson Williams logging an entire season and the team having confidence ending the year with a win over the Packers in Lambeau and finishing with a winning record (9-8). For 2023, expect him to be another solid late-round pick usable only in plus home matchups.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

He put on a show at the NFL Combine and finds himself on an Indianapolis Colts squad in desperate need of his playmaking ability. Head coach Shane Steichen is a QB whisperer coordinating Justin Herbert's record-setting rookie season and Jalen Hurts' breakout campaign. Management has also hinted at Richardson getting experience as the starter sooner than later. Keep in mind that every rookie QB over the last 20 years that crossed 80 total rushing attempts maintained a top-10 QB per game pace. That’s roughly 4.7 carries per game, a number Richardson can achieve even in Year 1. As a thrower, he’s going to be a work in progress likely with low total passing volume so it’s unlikely he’s a game-breaker right away.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+.

He wasn’t afraid to chuck it deep, throwing 20+ yards downfield at the highest rate in the NFL. It's safe to say Mr. Unlimited was anything but...we'll see if this was just a one-year fluke with a bad scheme or if Russ has really lost it. Sean Payton will look to recreate the same magic he did with Drew Brees. If you have too many wounds from 2022, we get it.

The 49ers were on a roll down the stretch with him winning his final six starts as he posted three top-10 fantasy performances.

His Week 1 status is up in the air but there is some optimism he returns sooner than the public realizes. The Cardinals have the highest projected odds to pick No. 1 overall next year. In other words, this could be a lost year in the desert for the franchise but Kyler’s ability to run is not going to suddenly evaporate.

The Cardinals could deploy him (or rookie Clayton Tune) at some point if Kyler's injury is worse than we imagine or if this team is going full ""pack-it-in""-mode and jumps ship for Caleb Williams in the 2024 draft.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+.

"Trey Lance","SF","9","36","0.0","8.5","7.5","17.02","9","It's Year 3 and we're still not sure Lance even knows who he is. The 49ers traded the house for him and ended up... with Brock Purdy. Lance has four total starts in two years and one of those was a monsoon game against Chicago. All early indications are pro-Purdy especially when you consider how the 7th rounder stepped and went on an insane run at the end of the year. Lance could get an opportunity if Purdy's rehab is slower than expected but it is a complete gamble. In deep 2QB leagues, he is worth taking a stab at on rushing upside alone but unless he is named the starter in San Francisco, we'll always be wondering what Trey Lance could be for fantasy.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+.

"Will Levis","TEN","7","37","0.0","5.0","3.0","22.12","9","If you are a fan of a high-T approach and the “prove ‘em all wrong” motivational tactic, Levis should be your QB1. Heck, if his methods for eating bananas are your cup of tea, induct him in the Hall of Fame. Jokes aside, Levis should be given some run ahead of Ryan Tannehill if the Titans fall out of contention at some point. His strong arm and ultra-aggressiveness as a runner is a strong formula for future fantasy goodness. We caution against expecting much in Year 1.","Unlock with the 2023 UDK+.
